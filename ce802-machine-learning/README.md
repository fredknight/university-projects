- '**Design and Application of a Machine Learning System for a Practical Problem**'

  - This project involves performing a full comparative study of various machine learning procedures for a set of practical problems. The project consisted of a pilot study for an initial (classification) problem, a comparative study based on the study for that problem, a second comparative study of a new (regression) problem, and a final report summarising the comparative study and the insights gained from it.
