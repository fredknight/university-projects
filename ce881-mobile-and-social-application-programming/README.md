# CE881 Mobile and Social Application Programming

This directory contains the work associated with the module **CE881 Mobile and Social Application Programming**.

This module's project is split into two parts, in order to ensure that steady progress was made. Each part is graded independently, however the second part ('**Completed App**') directly builds on progress made in the first part ('**App Design**').

- App Design

  - This project involves writing a report on the conception, design, and business models related to a mobile application, before developing a simple prototype of the application based on this design.

- Completed App

  - This project involves developing the completed application, building on the work completed within the '**App Design**' project. Alongside this, a report should be written to demonstrate progress with the development and the implementation of the app, and a presentation to demonstrate the applications features and code.
