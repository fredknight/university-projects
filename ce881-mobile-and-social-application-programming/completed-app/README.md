# App Design

The aim of this project was to finish development on a completed application, building on the work completed within the '**App Design**' project. Alongside this, a report should be written to demonstrate progress with the development and the implementation of the app, and a presentation to demonstrate the applications features and code.

The developed application should be fully functional, which would recieve a higher grade if a working **APK** file was submitted alongside the project. This application had to function in line with the specifications and features planned in the original design within the '**App Design**' project, and clear progress on the original prototype application should also be apparent. Any changes from the original design are acceptable, however these design changes would require proper justification and documentation in the report.

The report acted as an overview of the applications development process, discussing how features were implemented and justifying choices made. A brief description of the application (similar to Google Play Store descriptions) had to be provided to demonstrate that we can market the application well in a brief comment.

The design, features, and implementation of various parts of the application then had to be discussed. This included use of screenshots and figures in order to demonstrate how navigation between various activities and fragments would function. Implemented features had to be described, and any unimplemented features or improvements from the original design had to be explained and justified. Brief testing on the application and its features then had to be discussed within the report, to demonstrate that the application was working as intended. These test consisted of simple actions that an end user may perform.

Finally, a full demonstration of the application's code and functionality was required, as well as a short presentation to promote the application and its key features.

The purpose of the files and directories within this project are explained briefly below:

- '**report.pdf**'

  - This file contains the contents of the report to demonstrate the progress with the development and the implementation of the application.

- '**presentation.pptx**'

  - This file contains the slides used to present and promote the application during my demonstration.

- '**app-debug.apk**'

  - This file contains the executable APK of the application. It is in a working state, and should only need to be simply installed on an android device to run.

- '**report-figures**'

  - This directory contains the various diagrams and figures used within the report.

- '**sudoku-application**'

  - This directory contains the source code for the application.

## Project Feedback

Below is the project feedback as it was presented to me. I was awarded a grade of **86%** on this project.
