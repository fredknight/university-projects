# App Design

The aim of this project was to write a report on the conception, design, and business models related to a mobile application, before developing a simple prototype of the application based on this design.

The purpose of this project was to demonstrate working knowledge of design concepts for mobile applications. Instead of just making an app, this task ensured that every decision made would be justifiable, allowing for a solid foundation in which to build the application.

The application first had to have a purpose (entertainment, organisation, etc) comprised of a problem that it will address, along with market research into preixisting applications in order to get an idea of the relative size of the market for this type of application, and how the proposed application would be different. The application idea generation and validation process would also be required, ensuring that ideas were properly thought through and developed to improve their quality. Along with this, a proper business model for the application had to be discussed, such as how the application would be monetised.

Desireable and essential features would then be required, before a proper initial design and structure of the application was built. This consisted of the separate activities, menus, intents, and fragments that make up the proposed application, as well as any external services that would be used. The full lifecycle of the application would have to be discussed, as well as how persistent data would be managed between sessions. This would then need to be visualised within a series of wireframe diagrams.

As well as the previously mentioned wireframe diagrams, a series of user stories had to be drafted in order to demonstrate how crucial application usages would be managed, detailing how the end user would perform a set task.

A minimum viable prototype of the application was then developed using this report, which would recieve a higher grade if a working **APK** file was submitted alongside the project. Whilst extremely basic at this stage, its purpose was to validate that the design would be reasonably practical to develop within the time given.

The purpose of the files and directories within this project are explained briefly below:

- '**report.pdf**'

  - This file contains the contents of the report on the design and conception of the proposed application.

- '**user-journey.pptx**'

  - This file contains the slides used to present the various user stories that are relevant to this application.

- '**app-debug.apk**'

  - This file contains the executable APK of the application. It is in a working state, and should only need to be simply installed on an android device to run.

- '**wireframes**'

  - This directory contains the various wireframe diagrams used within the report.

- '**sudoku-application**'

  - This directory contains the source code for the application.

## Project Feedback

Below is the project feedback as it was presented to me. I was awarded a grade of **95%** on this project.

Excellent work on all sections in the report. Splendid job presenting the wireframes and user story as well.
