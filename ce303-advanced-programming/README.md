- '**Simple Stock Trading Platform**'

  - This project involves developing a platform within Python and C# to trade a single 'stock'. The project uses a socket-based client-server architecture, where multiple instances of the client programs can connect and communicate within the server program. The project also consisted of adapting the original Java code to C# to demonstrate some differences between the languages. Both the Java and C# programs are fully compatible with one another.
