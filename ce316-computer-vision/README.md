This directory contains the work associated with the module **CE316 Computer Vision**.

- '**Stereo Object Image Detection**'

  - This project involves developing a Python program to detect objects and monitor their movement using the ['**OpenCV**'](https://opencv.org/) computer vision library. The project involved using frames of the same scene taken from two separate cameras, and using the provided camera specifications in order to properly monitor the three-dimensional position of objects within the scene.
