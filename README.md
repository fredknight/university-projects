# University Projects

This repository contains key projects from my time at the **University of Essex**, as well as their accompanying feedback. Any problems that I am aware of that are not explicitly stated in feedback (or if the feedback is not as detailed as it could be), then these will be brought up briefly in the project's respective README.md.

Prior to this, I had been using **GitLab** on the university's server in order to manage projects. However, due to losing access to this I unfortunately no longer have the commit history; and instead this repository is just a showcase of my final submitted work that I have been able to retrieve and reupload to **GitHub**.

Over time I may update this repository by adding more projects, or amending projects by adding missing files and dependencies. However, I will not be altering the code as this repository's purpose is to provide a snapshot of my work. If I decide to improve on any existing project in this repository, this will be done in a separate repository (with a link to it provided in the original project's README.md).

## Open Essex

I had also taken the optional Open Essex course '**An Introduction to Python**'. Whilst this was unnecessary as it was a short course mainly designed to get users up and running with the basics who may not have had Python experience before taking their postgraduate degree, it was still a provided resource that I made use of. There was no real project within this course, instead being comprised of short exercises (such as **FizzBuzz**).
